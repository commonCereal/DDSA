# Dart Data Structures & Algorithms Library (DDSA)

This open source project is about implementing algorithms, data structures, as well as
software design patterns with pure Dart (that is, no dependencies).


### About The Project.
Ever since I started working with Dart back in 2016, I have truly enjoyed this language and have
enjoyed watching the community grow. Back in college I wrote a [silly little package ](https://pub.dev/packages/dart_constructs) to help manage
matrices of N dimensions, little did I know (until I went and learned some Python) that I was essentially implementing a basic version of numpy's
[ndarray](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.ndarray.html) but in Dart. I hope to find time to revisit that project and give
it some much needed love.

In the meantime, I figured it was about time I set up a repo where I can contribute knowledge of how to implement various
things in Dart to share with the community. Bonus is I get to use it to take time to re-learn algorithms,
data structures, and design patterns I studied in college, as well as new ones that excite me. If you'd
like to also contribute to the project, check out the [Contributing.md]().
