# Dart Data Structures & Algorithms Library (DDSA)

This open source project is about implementing algorithms, data structures, as well as
software design patterns with pure Dart (that is, no dependencies).


### About The Project.
Ever since I started working with Dart back in 2016, I have truly enjoyed this language and have
enjoyed watching the community grow. Back in college I wrote a silly little package to help manage
matrices of N dimensions, little did I know I was essentially implementing a basic version of numpy's
ndarray but in Dart.

I figured it was about time I set up a repo where I can contribute knowledge of how to implement various
things in Dart to share with the community. Bonus is I get to use it to take time to re-learn algorithms,
data structures, and design patterns I studied in college, as well as new ones that excite me. If you'd
like to also contribute to the project, check out the [Contributing.md]().
